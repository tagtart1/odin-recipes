    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This right here is probably the <em>best</em> cookies you are ever going to try. After trying the crumble cookie shop near me and having a bite of the chocolate chip cookie, I was appalled. How could such a simple chocolate chip cookie taste so amazing? Here's the recipe on how to make a cookie as big as your palm and warm and gooey on the inside.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cake flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> 2 cups milk chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>yield:</em> 1 Dozen</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugars on high speed for 3-5 minutes, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add eggs and vanilla and beat for 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Mix in flours, baking soda and salt. Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Measure 1/3 cup of dough and form into a ball. Pull the ball in half, then press it back together with one of the jagged edges facing up. Place the dough balls on the prepared cookies sheets, 2 inches apart (6 cookies per sheet).</li>
        <li>Bake for about 10 minutes, or until cookies are just golden. Do not over bake. Let sit on cookie sheet for ten minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
